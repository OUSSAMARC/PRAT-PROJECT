## Cerberus: Multi-Task Learning for Computational Pathology

# Overview

Cerberus is a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model designed for Computational Pathology (CPath) applications. It leverages deep learning techniques to perform simultaneous segmentation, classification, and object detection on histological images. The primary objective of this project is to review, optimize, and apply transfer learning to the Cerberus model, enhancing its generalization capabilities across different pathology datasets.
