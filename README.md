# Cerberus: Multi-Task Learning for Computational Pathology

## Overview

Cerberus is a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model designed for Computational Pathology (CPath) applications. It leverages deep learning techniques to perform simultaneous segmentation, classification, and object detection on histological images. The primary objective of this project is to review, optimize, and apply transfer learning to the Cerberus model, enhancing its generalization capabilities across different pathology datasets.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Task Learning (MTL):} Simultaneously handles multiple histological analysis tasks.
    \item \textbf{Efficient Transfer Learning:} Utilizes pre-trained knowledge for improved segmentation and classification.
    \item \textbf{Optimized for Histopathology:} Specially designed for nuclei, gland, lumina segmentation, and tissue classification.
    \item \textbf{Advanced Training Strategies:} Uses dynamic weight freezing and task-aligned training methodologies.
    \item \textbf{Post-Processing Techniques:} Enhances segmentation results with morphological operations.
\end{itemize}
